## History

These guidelines are strongly inspired by the excellent prior art of [ESLint](https://eslint.org/donate/) and [WebdriverIO](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md\#sponsoring-and-donations).

They were initally drafted for the [mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard) projects, aiming to provide them and other projects a common baseline that's easy to adopt and provides clarity on usage of funds – for maintainers as well as community.

First draft was written by [@voxpelli](https://github.com/voxpelli) with review and feedback from fellow co-maintainers and community.

To fascilitate feedback the [Collective Funds](https://github.com/collective-funds) group was set up, to help the community evolve the guidelines further.
