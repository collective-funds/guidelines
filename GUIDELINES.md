# Collective Funds Guidelines 0.1.0

## Purpose

The primary use of funds collected for the project is for the health and benefit of it and its community. All use of funds should be of direct benefit to that.

## Definitions

* `TSC` – refers to the Technical Steering Commitee of a project or, for those projects that lack an explicit `TSC`, the lead maintainer(s) of the project
* `Contributors` – refers to any non-`TSC` member of of the project

## Allocation of money

* 70% Project Development
* 0% Travel and Event Expenses
* 10% Contributor Pool
* 20% Dependencies and Community Projects
* \<1% Support Systems

A project using these guidelines can decide to specify their own allocation and/or limit any specific area to a minimum/maximum amount.

The allocation is based on monthly or yearly funds – estimated, average or actual ones (depending on availability and reliability of data).

The project will keep a level of transparency that makes it possible for givers to roughly follow up on this allocation, but exact level of transparency is out-of-scope of these guidelines.

### Project Development

Expenses can be submitted by project members (Project Contributors or TSC Members).

Contributions include submitting code, writing documentation, answering questions in chat, attending meetings on behalf of the project, and so on. All contributions to an open-source project are valuable, and we feel that compensating team members for any time they spend on the project is the right thing to do.

Project members should track their time and submit a monthly invoice at the beginning of the month with those hours split up across the following categories and across any sub-projects / areas within the project:

* Discord/Discussions Help
* Infrastructure
* Issues/Pull Request Triage
* Meetings
* Programming
* Project Management
* Writing

Before doing and submitting significant expenses a project's members should get pre-approval from the TSC.

#### Conflict of Interest

To ensure transparency and avoid conflicts of interest, contributors and TSC members should not request compensation from the project for specific work (e.g., features, bug fixes) that has already been directly funded by other sources, such as employer contracts, external sponsorships, or crowdfunding campaigns.

However, the TSC may evaluate scenarios on a case-by-case basis and may agree to co-fund specific work if a suitable arrangement can be reached.

Personal non-targeted donations such as GitHub Sponsors should generally not classify as direct funding, unless eg. specifically mentioned or requested together with specific work.

#### Hourly rates

* **TSC Members:** $80.00 USD/hour
* **Project Contributors:** $50.00 USD/hour

Projects using these guidelines can, and are encouraged to, specify their own rates that are adjusted for their project's financial capabilities. See “How To Adopt”.

### Travel and Event Expenses

Guidelines for this are out of scope of these financial guidelines and should be defined separately by those wanting to use it. See eg. [WebdriverIO](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md\#travel-and-event-expenses) for inspiration.

### Contributor Pool

The project sets aside money to pay outside contributors who have made significant contributions to the project.

Contributions include submitting code, writing documentation, answering questions in our Discord server, and more.

### Dependencies and Community Projects

The project believe that open source projects who are lucky enough to get funded have a responsibility to pay that forward and support the smaller projects they rely on and as such uses its funds to support its dependencies

The project also supports auxiliary projects that benefit its community at large by augmenting or extending the project, or similar.

These funds should generally not go to projects maintained by members of this project as members should get compensated through the *Project Development* funds.

### Support systems

The project uses this to pay for software the team uses to help manage the project, which can include things like Google Workspace and cloud storage.

## Special projects

### Contractors

Additionally, from time to time the TSC can use funds to pay contractors to work on things that are important to the project and where the team doesn’t have the time or expertise to complete the work on their own.

### Tech debt / maintenance

Funds allowing, the TSC can decide that for a period of time it allows its members to submit expenditures that go beyond what the project takes in monthly, to allow for extended maintenance and/or handling of tech debt.

The TSC should then decide a guiding upper limit for what each member can expense monthly.

## Credits

These guidelines have been strongly inspired by the excellent work of the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/donate/) and [WebdriverIO](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md\#sponsoring-and-donations) projects and were created for the [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard) projects, with feedback given from the co-maintainers of those projects.
